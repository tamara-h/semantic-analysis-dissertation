Ant_Robot_339_506	3.0	3.0	2.0	b'Unfortunately as of yet no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society'
Ant_Robot_507_563	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Infiltrating insect societies however is much simpler'
Ant_Robot_564_803	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees ants and cockroaches and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already Halloy et al 2007'
Ant_Robot_804_1139	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'No robot has yet been constructed however that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them'
Ant_Robot_1140_1262	3.0	3.0	4.0	b'Such a robot would allow for both longterm studies of antrobot interactions and studies of taskswitching in the robots'
Ant_Robot_1263_1494	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot hereafter referred to as Antie that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest switching between the foraging patrolling and midden work behaviors'

Ant_Robot_1544_1685	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The red harvester ant lives in hot dry deserts building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain'
Ant_Robot_1686_1920	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds many of which do not grow in the desert Gordon 54 where only a few varieties of small shrubs small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow Gordon 51'

Ant_Robot_2531_2631	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Ants of this species are of two types breeding ants queens and drones and sterile female workers'
Ant_Robot_2632_2834	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season which occurs but once per year'
Ant_Robot_2835_2969	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories brood care nest maintenance patrolling and foraging'
Ant_Robot_2970_3127	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Little is known about brood care as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest'
Ant_Robot_3128_3382	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest midden work occurs close enough to the surface to be observable'
Ant_Robot_3383_3579	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Patrolling and foraging too occur for the most part outside of the nest and have therefore been studied extensively ex Schafer et al 2006 Gordon et al 2002 Gordon 2002 Gordon 1987'
Ant_Robot_3839_3993	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler though there is some overlap particularly with navigational problems'
Ant_Robot_3994_4236	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In the case of midden work Antie must be able to identify garbage grasp it carry it out of the nest and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum or until stimulated to switch behaviors'
Ant_Robot_4237_4333	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Patrolling may be divided into two distinct subbehaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling'
Ant_Robot_4334_4601	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit'
Ant_Robot_4602_4914	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers\xe2\x80\x99 cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers who may then upon smelling the returning patroller be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest'
Ant_Robot_4915_5103	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest wander around searching for food sources identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is'
Ant_Robot_5104_5377	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow Gordon 3334 Holldobler et al 1990 as cited in Webb 1998'

Ant_Robot_8373_8595	4.0	3.0	3.0	b'The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation and the bump sensors will when depressed also initiate the escape function'
Ant_Robot_8596_8740	3.0	4.0	3.0	b'The sonar will correspond to the ant\xe2\x80\x99s limited optical object detection ability and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions'
Ant_Robot_8753_8959	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and 45 degrees from the center front of Antie respectively that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern'
Ant_Robot_8960_9254	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants\xe2\x80\x99 eyes sensitive to polarized light and research has shown that many insects including ants do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer Labhart et al 2002'
Ant_Robot_9255_9487	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos Moller Labhart Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000 consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers'

Ant_Robot_9858_10062	3.0	4.0	3.0	b'This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning'

Ant_Robot_20134_20249	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode and are compiled here for ease of reference'
Ant_Robot_23162_23558	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside innest navigation an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into object identification and gripping a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following and the identification of other ants'
Ant_Robot_23571_23723	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'For a simple start the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed'
Ant_Robot_25547_25725	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis and when combined with the forward cruise function should cause the robot to move at an angle'
Ant_Robot_25738_25959	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading and also how far from the nest it is at its current location'
Ant_Robot_25960_26089	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos et al'
Ant_Robot_26090_26314	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance'
Ant_Robot_26315_26479	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees positive or negative and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters'
Ant_Robot_26480_26530	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The first function might look something like this'
Ant_Robot_27478_27583	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Innest navigation will be a function of the temperature read by Antie\xe2\x80\x99s thermometer and a light source'

Ant_Robot_28951_29112	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Each of Antie\xe2\x80\x99s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction'
Ant_Robot_29113_29161	3.0	4.0	3.0	b'Regardless this will be a very simple function'
Ant_Robot_29162_29189	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'I will include one example'
Ant_Robot_29941_30195	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie\xe2\x80\x99s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds'
Ant_Robot_30208_30277	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Before picking objects up however Antie will need to identify them'
Ant_Robot_30278_30411	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated'
Ant_Robot_30412_30505	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell'
Ant_Robot_30544_30582	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The code may look something like this'

Ant_Robot_32118_32185	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'A void function release will perform this same action in reverse'
Ant_Robot_32198_32401	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers and localize the source of foododors and middenodors'

Ant_Robot_32950_33250	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book \xe2\x80\x9cVehicles Experiments in Synthetic Psychology\xe2\x80\x9d as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell et al 2003 to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models'
Ant_Robot_33251_33412	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine'
Ant_Robot_33413_33479	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis'
Ant_Robot_34197_34329	2.0	3.0	3.0	b'For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow findFood and findMidden'

Ant_Robot_34381_34458	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants'
Ant_Robot_34459_34606	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate'
Ant_Robot_34607_34748	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with nonnestmates Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest'
Ant_Robot_34749_34957	2.0	3.0	3.0	b'Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of nalkenes to nalkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched nalkanes'
Ant_Robot_35073_35165	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the nalkene levels'
Ant_Robot_35166_35264	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this'
Ant_Robot_36254_36326	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Using these basic common behaviors more complex behaviors may be coded'
Ant_Robot_36339_36491	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony Gordon 1996'
Ant_Robot_36492_36733	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age ex Ingram et al 2005 and partially as a function of interactions with other workers ex Schafer et al 2006 Gordon 2002 Greene  Gordon 2007'
Ant_Robot_36734_36816	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Younger ants work more inside the nest and older ants work more outside the nest'
Ant_Robot_36817_36912	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'As a result I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in'
Ant_Robot_36913_37156	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Midden work which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside will occur first patrolling which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside will occur second and foraging will be the final behavior'
Ant_Robot_37157_37247	3.0	4.0	3.0	b'Finally I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors'
Ant_Robot_37260_37326	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The midden work behavior will be Antie\xe2\x80\x99s default initial behavior'
Ant_Robot_37327_37506	4.0	3.0	3.0	b'It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52\xc2\xad\xc2\xad\xc2\xadoC at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest'
Ant_Robot_37507_37683	2.0	3.0	3.0	b'As previously stated a midden worker must identify midden grasp it and carry it to the surface depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden'
Ant_Robot_37684_37738	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'A program encoding this behavior might look like this'
Ant_Robot_38994_39092	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The second behavior patrolling involves two subbehaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling'
Ant_Robot_39093_39216	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes and reentering the nest'
Ant_Robot_39217_39310	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'This behavior will be implemented in two parts with a taskswitching algorithm based on age'
Ant_Robot_39311_39565	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy Moron et al 2007 and that taskswitching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages Ingram et al 2005'
Ant_Robot_39566_39686	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling'
Ant_Robot_39687_39828	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In order to perform both of these functions Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zigzag fashion as harvester ants do Gordon 34'

Bartok_1234_1563	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion it is perfectly accurate the movement is in sonata form but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement not unheard of in Mozart sonatas and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order'
Bartok_1564_1683	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The \xe2\x80\x9cbackwards\xe2\x80\x9d recapitulation is a technique that Bart\xc3\xb3k employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates'

Bartok_1807_1940	2.0	3.0	3.0	b'Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction'
Bartok_1941_2189	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'As the example shows the development section is divided into three subsections the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition'
Bartok_2190_2369	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Hence on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTGSTGFTG which makes the overall form with the exception of the Introduction symmetric'

Bartok_3174_3210	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'To begin with the movement is in F'
Bartok_3211_3488	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'When we say \xe2\x80\x9cin F\xe2\x80\x9d we do not imply F major or minor for that matter\xe2\x80\x94the majorminor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece\xe2\x80\x94but rather that the pitchclass F is the tonal center of the movement and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement'
Bartok_3489_3616	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Using this interpretation we can map out the local tonics tonal centers used throughout the movement as shown in Example 2'
Bartok_3735_3949	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In this example the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece Introduction\xe2\x80\x93Exposition\xe2\x80\x93Development\xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x93Recapitulation\xe2\x80\x94so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins'
Bartok_3950_4223	2.0	3.0	4.0	b'Beginning with the exposition the largescale progression of tonal centers is a wholetone descent from F to F represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2 while the Introduction ascends from C\xe2\x99\xaf to F through D\xe2\x99\xaf shown as D\xe2\x99\xad and E\xe2\x99\xad in the graph in a quasibass Anstieg'
Bartok_4224_4413	2.0	3.0	3.0	b'The middle pitch of the descent B acts as the \xe2\x80\x9cdominant\xe2\x80\x9d to F based on its symmetrical division of the wholetone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition'
Bartok_4414_4598	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Bart\xc3\xb3k has often applied a tonicdominant relationship to a pitchclass and its tritone partner and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet'

Bartok_5535_5551	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The Introduction'
Bartok_5564_5694	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'As Paul Wilson points out the title \xe2\x80\x9cIntroduzione\xe2\x80\x9d given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures'
Bartok_5742_6025	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement\xe2\x80\x94in fact it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section\xe2\x80\x94but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece'
Bartok_6026_6176	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'To begin with the opening motive in the celli and basses shown in Example 3 outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C\xe2\x99\xaf as the tonal center'
Bartok_6177_6348	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitchclass set and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale'
Bartok_6349_6459	2.0	3.0	3.0	b'Indeed this set can be seen more as a byproduct of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself'
Bartok_6460_6654	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive'
Bartok_6655_6874	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Furthermore the following two instances of this opening motive shown in Examples 4 and 5 remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set'
Bartok_7190_7329	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Example 4 transitions from C\xe2\x99\xaf to F\xe2\x99\xaf and adds pitchclass E to the pentatonic set of Example 3 creating a sixnote set of stacked fourths'
Bartok_7330_7450	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth the set created is a tennote set derived by stacking fourths'
Bartok_7469_7600	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'If we begin from the final D\xe2\x99\xaf and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example'
Bartok_7617_7722	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Each note is either approached or left or both by a fourth and the structural motion is from F\xe2\x99\xaf to D\xe2\x99\xaf'
Bartok_7723_7859	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C\xe2\x99\xaf to D\xe2\x99\xaf through F\xe2\x99\xaf these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D\xe2\x99\xad E\xe2\x99\xad and G\xe2\x99\xad'
Bartok_7860_7988	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'As previously mentioned this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a wholetone descent from F to F'
Bartok_7989_8153	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a usually ascending perfect fourth'
Bartok_8154_8344	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths indeed the structural wholetone descent is often \xe2\x80\x9cfilled in\xe2\x80\x9d with the intervening fourth'
Bartok_8345_8415	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group mm'
Bartok_8416_8559	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'155233 and as we will see it occurs in other places though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2'
Bartok_8573_8840	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths the same sequence of intervals occurs two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second 5 2 5 each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples'

Bartok_14696_14879	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Rather we can consider this occurrence of E\xe2\x99\xad as a middlegroundlevel wholetone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E\xe2\x99\xad at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2'

Bartok_15150_15324	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The descent in measures 9195 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger'
Bartok_15325_15493	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge'

Bartok_21701_21944	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Both B\xe2\x99\xad and A\xe2\x99\xad are chromatic neighbors to A which intensifies the arrival on A and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the largescale wholetone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section'

Bartok_22435_22598	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D which constitutes another \xe2\x80\x9cfilling in\xe2\x80\x9d of the wholestep by the intervening fourth'

Bartok_23177_23298	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such however there are some important differences'
Bartok_23299_23487	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Firstly its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it the first chord in Example 9 is an Fminor triad and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the Fminor scale'
Bartok_23488_23626	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In the recapitulation of this theme shown in Example 19 the first chord is an Fmajor chord and the A\xe2\x99\xad is replaced by A\xe2\x99\xae in the melody'
Bartok_23627_24007	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In fact the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as IviV in F major\xe2\x80\x94while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major the conspicuous A\xe2\x99\xad in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation'
Bartok_24020_24261	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In addition to the \xe2\x80\x9cmode\xe2\x80\x9dshift we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19 and also that the written meter no longer changes'
Bartok_24262_24478	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'In other words the piece in becoming more regular is beginning to drive towards the finish\xe2\x80\x94because of the formal structure the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement'
Bartok_24479_24635	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Indeed this section has the feel of a Coda to it\xe2\x80\x94it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection and the tonic harmony is active throughout'
Bartok_24636_24881	3.0	4.0	3.0	b'There are also no phrase divisions\xe2\x80\x94the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514 where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious VI cadence signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes'

Ohio_Steel_14796_14904	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Actually one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do'
Ohio_Steel_14905_15067	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before and none of the leaders of USWA not even president Lynn Williams knew what could be done'
Ohio_Steel_15068_15257	3.0	2.0	2.0	b'It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered'

Ohio_Steel_15482_15597	3.0	3.0	2.0	b'Besides incompetence the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart fear of socialism'
Ohio_Steel_15598_15825	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism'
Ohio_Steel_15826_16098	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories then the government and potentially other important people and institutions as well might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism'
Ohio_Steel_16099_16231	3.0	2.0	2.0	b'This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people something they could not afford to do'

easy_money_12051_12182	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'You could step on that marker and make the gestures the device and it would be like pushing a button in a very complex machine'
easy_money_12183_12228	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'You would end up on a small hill on Rapa Nui'

audubon1_780_967	3.0	3.0	3.0	b'it\xe2\x80\x99s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented  in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people'
