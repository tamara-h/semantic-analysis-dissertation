110CYL068_18_24	Dear ,
110CYL068_31_156	A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill's help.
110CYL068_163_275	Here's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source: Goodwill's controller, Juli.
110CYL068_276_386	She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars.
110CYL068_387_522	In addition to that, by helping them find jobs, Goodwill reduced the state's Public Support tab by an estimated $4 million.
110CYL068_523_653	Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work.
110CYL068_660_695	What kind of work does Goodwill do?
110CYL068_702_771	Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities.
110CYL068_778_1035	After Maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant, we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society.
110CYL068_1036_1079	Remember what she said in my last letter? "
110CYL068_1079_1110	If I wasn't working here.
110CYL068_1110_1127	..I would be sad.
110CYL068_1127_1130	.."
110CYL068_1137_1188	Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance.
110CYL068_1189_1328	Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family.
110CYL068_1329_1475	At Goodwill she gained in self-confidence, in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job. "
110CYL068_1475_1558	Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent.
110CYL068_1559_1601	I am now... totally off of welfare."
110CYL068_1608_1658	Goodwill prepares people for life-long employment.
110CYL068_1659_1810	Cornell found a number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a work-site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry.
110CYL068_1811_1946	He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new-found skills in a burgeoning industry. "
110CYL068_1946_1997	I've got more than a job; I've got a career."
110CYL068_2004_2039	Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill.
110CYL068_2040_2141	After a lifetime of trials, Donna not only earned her GED at Goodwill, she earned a job here. "
110CYL068_2141_2194	I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow.
110CYL068_2195_2216	I wanted to be there.
110CYL068_2216_2266	..I had my second chance to change my life."
110CYL068_2273_2373	Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success.
110CYL068_2374_2413	Your support will help them go to work.
110CYL068_2420_2501	Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill today!
110CYL068_2508_2518	Sincerely,
110CYL068_2525_2582	William A Carter, Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation
110CYL068_2589_2593	P.S.
110CYL068_2594_2642	Your gift is a wise investment in the community.
110CYL068_2643_2750	For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998, we helped our "graduates" earn an estimated $102.
110CYL068_2751_2841	That money was then spent in a variety of ways, adding fuel to our thriving economy.
